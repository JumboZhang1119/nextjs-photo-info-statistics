### Privacy Statement

Your privacy is paramount. All statistical analysis is performed **entirely within your local browser**. No photo data or EXIF information is ever uploaded to or stored on any server.

For the best experience and full functionality (including local folder access via the File System Access API), using a modern Chromium-based browser like **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** is recommended.

### Features

This tool allows you to gain insights into your photography habits through several key analyses:

-   **Flexible Filtering & Configuration**
    -   Select specific folders, camera bodies, and lenses to include in the analysis.
    -   Fine-tune your statistics by setting custom crop factors for each camera model (e.g., APS-C: 1.5x/1.6x, Full Frame: 1.0x) to ensure accurate equivalent focal length calculations.

-   **Analyze by Camera Model**
    -   Visualize the number of photos taken with each of your camera bodies.

-   **Analyze by Lens Model**
    -   Get a clear breakdown of which lenses you use the most.

-   **Analyze by Focal Length**
    -   Generate powerful statistics based on the equivalent focal length (35mm equivalent) of your shots, with two distinct modes:
        -   **Custom Ranges:** Define your own focal length brackets (e.g., 24-70mm, 70-200mm, 300mm+) to see the distribution and percentage of photos in each user-defined range.
        -   **Histogram View:** Display a detailed chart showing the photo count for every individual focal length used across your collection.
